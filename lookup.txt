LHS Lookup
    -LHS lookup refers to the process of finding the location where a value should be assigned or 
    -retrieved from a variable or property on the left side of an assignment statement.

    -It determines where to store the value or how to update the existing value of a variable 
    -or object property.


    Ex-
      -let x = 10; // LHS lookup: JavaScript looks for `x` in the current scope to assign `10`

      let obj = {};
      obj.name = 'Alice'; // LHS lookup: JavaScript looks for `name` property on `obj` and assigns `'Alice'`

      x = 20; // LHS lookup: JavaScript looks for `x` to update its value to `20`


RHS Lookup
    -RHS lookup refers to the process of finding the value of a variable or property that is used 
    -on the right side of an assignment statement.

    -It determines what value should be used to assign or operate on the variable or property

    -During an RHS lookup, JavaScript retrieves the value from the environment where the variable or 
    -property is located. It involves accessing the value thatâ€™s associated with a variable or property.

    Ex-
        console.log(x); // RHS lookup: JavaScript retrieves the value of `x` from the current scope

        let obj = { name: 'Alice' };
        console.log(obj.name); // RHS lookup: JavaScript retrieves the value of `name` property from `obj`

        let y = x + 5; // RHS lookup: JavaScript retrieves the value of `x`, adds `5`, and assigns it to `y`
