-The this keyword refers to the context where a piece of code, such as a function's body, is supposed to run.
-Most typically, it is used in object methods, where this refers to the object that the method is attached to,
thus allowing the same method to be reused on different objects.


-The value of this in JavaScript depends on how a function is invoked (runtime binding), not how it is 
 defined. When a regular function is invoked as a method of an object (obj.method()), this points to that 
 object. When invoked as a standalone function (not attached to an object: func()), this typically refers 
 to the global object (in non-strict mode) or undefined (in strict mode).



-Arrow functions differ in their handling of this: they inherit this from the parent scope at the time 
 they are defined. This behavior makes arrow functions particularly useful for callbacks and preserving 
 context. However, arrow functions do not have their own this binding. Therefore, their this value 
 cannot be set by bind(), apply() or call() methods, nor does it point to the current object in object 
 methods.


-The value of this always changes based on how a function is called, even when the function was defined 
 on an object at creation:

        //code
         const obj4 = {
            name: "obj4",
            getThis() {
                return this;
            },
         };

         const obj5 = { name: "obj5" };

         obj5.getThis = obj4.getThis;
         console.log(obj5.getThis()); // { name: 'obj5', getThis: [Function: getThis] }




//code
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  printName: function() {
    console.log(this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
  }
};
person.printName();// John Doe
const printFullName = person.printName;
printFullName();// undefined undefined

Here, we are storing a reference of person.printName to printFullName variable. After that, 
we are calling it without an object reference, so this will now refer to the window (global) object
or undefined (in strict mode).

If the script is in strict mode, this refers to undefined, so console.log() will return an error.


//code with explanation
const counter = {
  count: 0,
  incrementCounter: function() {
    console.log(this);
    this.count++;
  }
}
document.querySelector('.btn').addEventListener('click', counter.incrementCounter);
       
        -In the above snippet, the this keyword refers to the DOM element where the event happened, 
         not the counter object.

        -We use call, bind and apply methods to set the this keyword independent of how the function 
         is called. This is especially useful for the callbacks (as in the above example).


!!!! Bind() !!!!
    -The bind method creates a new function and sets the this keyword to the specified object.
    Syntax-
       function.bind(thisArg, optionalArguments)

    Ex-
         //code
         const john = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 24,
         };
         const jane = {
            name: 'Jane',
            age: 22,
         };
         function greeting() {
            console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`);
         }

         We can use the bind method on the greeting function to bind the this keyword
         to john and jane objects. For example:
            const greetingJohn = greeting.bind(john);
            // Hi, I am John and I am 24 years old
            greetingJohn();
            const greetingJane = greeting.bind(jane);
            // Hi, I am Jane and I am 22 years old
            greetingJane();


We can also use bind in case of callbacks and event handlers. For example:
       
//code
const counter = {
  count: 0,
  incrementCounter: function() {
    console.log(this);
    this.count++;
  }
}
document.querySelector('.btn').addEventListener('click', counter.incrementCounter.bind(counter));

In the above example, the this keyword inside the incrementCounter method will now correctly refer 
to the counter object instead of the event object.

We can also pass extra arguments to the bind method. The general syntax for this is 
function.bind(this, arg1, arg2, ...). For example:

//code
function greeting(lang) {
  console.log(`${lang}: I am ${this.name}`);
}
const john = {
  name: 'John'
};
const jane = {
  name: 'Jane'
};
const greetingJohn = greeting.bind(john, 'en');
greetingJohn();
const greetingJane = greeting.bind(jane, 'es');
greetingJane();

!!!!  Call()   !!!!
The call method sets the this inside the function and immediately executes that function.

The difference between call() and bind() is that the call() sets the this keyword and executes the 
function immediately and it does not create a new copy of the function, while the bind() creates a 
copy of that function and sets the this keyword.

Ex:
//code
function greeting() {
  console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`);
}
const john = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 24,
};
const jane = {
  name: 'Jane',
  age: 22,
};
// Hi, I am John and I am 24 years old
greeting.call(john);
// Hi, I am Jane and I am 22 years old
greeting.call(jane);

Call() also accepts a comma-separated list of arguments. The general syntax for this is 
function.call(this, arg1, arg2, ...)


!!!!  Apply()  !!!!
The apply() method is similar to call(). The difference is that the apply() method accepts an array of 
arguments instead of comma separated values.

Syntax:
function.apply(thisArg, [argumentsArr])
